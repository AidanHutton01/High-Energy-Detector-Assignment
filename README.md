# High-Energy-Detector-Assignment

This repository contains all my code and files used for the assignmnet. SpecPlot.py will work with one data file to make one plot. Calibrate.py will take a config file (see Example_config.txt) and produce a new data file which can then be fed into Resolution.py, Efficiency.py and OffAxis.py. The config files and the files output by Calibrate.py are a specific format, if changed significantly they will not be read properly by the scripts.
