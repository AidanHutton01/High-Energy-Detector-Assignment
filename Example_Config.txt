#for the best use of the Calibrate.py script name this file [DETECTOR_NAME]_config
#for region of interest (ROI) lines leave a space inbetween every value

EXPLAINATION:
SOURCENUMBER #leave blank, just for organising
NAME: #name of source
FILE: #file/directory of measurement (counts will be read from the file, should be .Spe or .mca)
TIME: #time of measurement (time used to remove background radiation)
ROI: #write ROI data (peak energy, ROI start, ROI end)		GUESSES: #write the initial guesses for a gaussian function (mean, standard deviation, amplitude), keep on the same line as ROI
D_ROI: #D_ denotes 2 overlapping peaks (double) you should enter both energy values before the channel limits 	GUESSES: #write guesses for two gaussians, they should be in the same order as the energies in the D_ROI
